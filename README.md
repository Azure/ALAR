# ALAR
#### Azure Linux Auto Recover

Azure Linux Auto Recover (ALAR) is a tool to assist with the most common issues to boot a Linux based VM. ALAR is designed to be used on the CLI from another Azure based Linux VM, in order to recover the OS disk from a VM which had a boot issue. It can also be used together with 'the az vm repair' extension to automate most of the VM repair creation.

The scenarios the tool can assist you are:

* malformed /etc/fstab 
  * syntax error
  * missing disk
* damaged initrd or /boot/grub/grub.cfg is missing the right setup
* last installed kernel is not bootable
* serial console and grub serial are not configured well
* GRUB/EFI installation or configuration damaged
* Disk full causing a non-boot scenario, specifically related to auditd configurations.

It has also the following features
* does support ADE. Either by decrypting the device, to be recovered, automatically 
  or with the help of an ADE encryption key passed over to the tool: `--ade-password <password>`
* A custom recover disk path can be specified if `LUN0`is already occupied: `--custom-recover-disk`
* By default all action scripts are incorporated into the ALAR tool. This can be of help
  if no access to the internet does exists. Though, if required the action scripts can be downloaded with the help of the flag `--download-action-scripts`
  this may be handy if a new action is available or an existing one got improved.
* A special action `chroot-cli` allows to fix things manually if the available action scripts aren't of the right choice. All things get setup automatically. The user gets automatically placed in a terminal belonging to the associated chroot session.
This option can't be used together with 'az vm repair run'

### What actions are available
#### fstab
This action does strip off any lines in the `/etc/fstab` file which are not needed to boot a system. It makes a copy of the original file first. So, after the start of the OS the administrator is able to edit the fstab again and correct any errors which didn’t allow a reboot of the system before. This action provides the following additional functionality.
-	If device names are found they get translated to an UUID identifier
-	If '/boot' or '/boot/efi' is missed it/they get added to the fstab configuration
-	The resource disk configuration isn’t removed


#### kernel
This action does change the default kernel.
It modifies the configuration so that the previous kernel version gets booted. After the boot the admin is able to replace the broken kernel.

#### initrd
This action corrects two issues that can happen when a new kernel gets installed 
1. The grub.cfg file is incorrect created
2. The initrd image is missing or corrupt

#### serialconsole
This action enables both the serialconsole and the GRUB serial. Incorrect vaules get overwritten by a set of defaults
The correct setup allows you to see the `GRUB Menu` as well get access to the system via the `Azure Serial Console`.

#### grubfix
This action is reinstalling `GRUB` and regenerates the `grub.cfg` file

#### efifix
This action is reinstalling the required software to boot from a `GEN2 VM`. The `grub.cfg` is regenerated as well.

#### auditd
This action will alter the auditd configuration, replacing any HALT directives in the `/etc/audit/auditd.conf` file. Also in LVM environments, if the volume containing the audit logs is full, and free space is available in the volume group, the logical volume will be extended by 10% of the current size.

### How to use ALAR
ALAR can be used either from the CLI of an existing Azure VM or with the help of the 
vm-repair extension for the Azure CLI tool.

#### From a SHELL prompt
In the simplest form: `alar <action-name>` i.e. `alar fstab`
If a specific disk and the ADE disk-encryption key is required: `alar <action-name> --custom-recover-disk <disk> --ade-password <key>` i.e. `# alar initrd --custom-recover-disk /deV/sdd --ade-password "password in base64 format"`

#### From the Azure CLI
Utilizing ALAR with the help of the Azure CLI is quite simple.
Create at fist a recover VM. We assume your VM named suse15 in the resource-group
    `az vm repair create --verbose -g suse15_group -n suse15 --repair-username rescue --repair-password 'password!234'`

In the next step the `run` command option is used to execute ALAR on the repair VM created before.

    `az vm repair run --verbose -g suse15_group -n suse15 --run-id linux-alar2 --parameters initrd --run-on-repair`

As a final step the `restore` command is used 
    `az vm repair restore --verbose -g suse15_group -n suse15`

Detailed information about the `vm-repair extension` is documented at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm/repair?view=azure-cli-latest

#### What to do if more than one ACTION is require?
If more than one action has to be applied this is possible as well. Pass over both to ALAR separated by a comma i.e. ‘fstab,initrd’
